```
# This file contains pin mappings for the Anycubic i3 Mega with
# Ultrabase from 2017. (This config may work on an Anycubic i3 Mega v1
# prior to the Ultrabase if you comment out the definition of the
# endstop_pin in the stepper_z1 section.) To use this config, the
# firmware should be compiled for the AVR atmega2560.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
